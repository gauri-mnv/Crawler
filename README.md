# 🕵️‍♂️ Professional NestJS Web Crawler & API Inspector

A powerful, high-performance web crawler built with **NestJS** and **Puppeteer**. It doesn't just scrape headlines; it intercepts network traffic to give you the **exact API responses** used by any website.

## 🌟 New & Advanced Features

  * **📡 Network Interception (Real-time)**
    Automatically captures and saves background API (XHR/Fetch) calls while crawling.

  * **📊 Professional Dashboard**
    Real-time stats for Headlines, Links, Paragraphs, and Total API Calls found.

  * **🔍 Deep API Inspector**
    A dedicated **"API Response Viewer"** tab that displays captured JSON data in an accurate, readable Table or JSON format.

  * **🤖 Stealth Mode**
    Uses custom User-Agents and Headers to mimic a real browser, avoiding `500 Internal Server Errors` and bot detection.

-----

## 📖 Deep Diving: How It Works

1.  **Target Entry:** User provides a URL (e.g., `https://example.com`).
2.  **Headless Browsing:** Puppeteer launches a stealth browser instance.
3.  **Traffic Sniffing:** While the page loads, the crawler listens to every `fetch` and `xhr` request.
4.  **Data Extraction:** Simultaneously extracts SEO elements like Headlines (`h1`-`h3`) and Paragraphs.
5.  **Saved Responses:** Every background API response is cached and ready for instant inspection.
