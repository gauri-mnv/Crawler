## 📖 What is Web Crawling?

Web crawling (also known as *spidering*) is the automated process of browsing the internet to collect data.

A crawler:

* Starts with a URL
* Extracts all links from the page
* Visits those links recursively
* Collects useful data along the way

### 🌍 Real-World Analogy

Imagine you're in a library:

1. You pick up a book about **Space**
2. Inside, you find a reference: *"See Book 405 for Mars"*
3. You go to Book 405
4. That book references another book on **Rockets**

A web crawler does exactly this—but at internet scale and speed.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## ⚠️ Best Practices

* Respect `robots.txt`
* Add request delays (rate limiting)
* Avoid scraping sensitive or protected content
* Use for ethical and legal purposes only

---

## 📌 Future Improvements Need TO Do

* Add pagination crawling (multi-page traversal)
* Store results in database
* Add keyword filtering
* Support JavaScript-heavy sites more robustly
* Add authentication & rate limiting
